# Custom blog generator

I am so sick and tired of keeping my Ghost blog up to date, it is suppossed to take away the pain of running a site and to let you (the user) focus on writing. So I am making my own "blogging platform"...

<div align="center">

    ![Yes I am aware](./.github/img/standards.png)

</div>

This template will have a focus on keeping the html static and having very little possibility for things to break. There will also be a focus on self hosting the result of the site generation, either through Github Pages or any webserver.

> It is not designed to be used by **Non developers** unfortunately. Customising this project will require some dev knowledge but it will mostly be JSON and Handlebar templates.


Steps of page generation:
- Compile SCSS
- Generate post pages
- Generate home page and other pages
- Prune the compiled CSS
